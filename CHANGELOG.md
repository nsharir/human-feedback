# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added — `install --hermes` now writes the rule into Hermes `MEMORY.md` (v1.7.1)

- The Hermes installer now appends a single managed memory entry to Hermes' `MEMORY.md` (project scope: `./.hermes/memories/MEMORY.md`, global scope: `~/.hermes/memories/MEMORY.md`). The entry is a short prose version of the >1-question + `-review` rules.
- Why: the Python `pre_llm_call` plugin hook only fires when Hermes has run `discover_plugins()` AND the plugin is enabled in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`. Hermes WebUI historically skipped plugin discovery, and `plugins.enabled` may not include `agent_feedback` even after install. In both failure modes the previously injected rule never reached the agent. Hermes' memory injection runs unconditionally on every turn, so the new entry guarantees rule delivery regardless of plugin state.
- Idempotent: the entry is wrapped in `<!-- agent-feedback:managed-rule:begin -->` / `:end` markers so re-running `install --hermes` does not duplicate it.
- Reversible: `uninstall --hermes` strips the managed block while preserving every other memory entry and any user-added prose.
- Result objects now carry a `memory` field: `{ file, wrote }` on install, `{ file, removed }` on uninstall.
- Tests: `test/installer.js` covers the new write path, idempotency, preservation of prior entries, and clean removal on uninstall.

## [1.7.0]

### Changed — auto-open is now OPT-IN; agent shares a `file://` link instead (v1.7.0)

- The post-write hook no longer launches a browser by default. After wrapping, it emits a `file://` link in the agent's reply message; the user clicks the link to open the review surface / questionnaire. This removes the disruptive browser pop when the agent finishes writing.
- Re-enable the old auto-launch behavior with `AGENT_FEEDBACK_AUTO_OPEN=1` (was `=0` to disable, before).
- Injected rule text updated: the canonical reply lines are now `"questionnaire ready ✓ — open: <file://link> — waiting on your response."` and `"review ready ✓ — open: <file://link> — waiting on your response."` — both relay the wrapped file's link verbatim.
- Test `test/post-write-hook.js` updated to assert the message carries a `file://...` link and does NOT claim the file was opened, in the default no-AUTO_OPEN-flag path.

### Added — "Other" free-text option enabled by default on choice questions (v1.6.1)

- `radio`, `checkbox`, and `select` question types now include an "Other…" option with a free-text input by default. Previously this required opt-in via `"other": true` in the question JSON.
- Opt out per-question with `"other": false`.

### Added — review-artifact rule + opt-in `-review` suffix whitelist (v1.6.0)

- The injected system-prompt rule now covers **two** contracts in one block: the existing >1-question rule AND a new review-artifact rule. Agents are told that any file the user must review must be named `<topic>-review.md` / `<topic>-review.html` — the hook auto-compiles + auto-opens it, and the agent replies only `review opened ✓ — waiting on your response.` and stops.
- `shouldWrap` is now an explicit **whitelist**: only `*-review.md`, `*-review.html`, and `questions*.json` get wrapped. Everything else — `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `SKILL.md`, source code, arbitrary scratch markdown — passes through silently. This stops the hook from popping a browser every time the agent writes a routine `.md`.
- Defense-in-depth: a name-based skip list (`CHANGELOG|README|AGENTS|CLAUDE|SKILL|CONTRIBUTING|LICENSE|NOTICE|TODO|NOTES|HOOK|PLUGIN`) catches accidental misnames.
- Rule text rewritten for token efficiency — ~40% shorter while covering both rules and the opt-out env vars.

### Hook architecture

- The single shared post-write hook (`plugins/shared/post-write-hook.js`) remains the **only** hook in use. Every event (`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `beforeSubmitPrompt`, `PostToolUse`, `afterFileEdit`, Hermes `pre_llm_call`, Hermes `post_tool_call`) routes through one binary entry point (`agent-feedback __hook`). No second hook script, no harness-specific dispatchers.

## [1.5.0]

### Added — system-prompt rule injection across all harnesses
- **The >1-question rule now reaches the agent at session start, not just after it writes a file.** Each harness's hook config gains additional managed groups that route the agent's native context-injection events to the shared `agent-feedback __hook` binary:
  - **Claude Code:** `SessionStart` + `UserPromptSubmit` → `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`
  - **Codex:** `SessionStart` + `UserPromptSubmit` → `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`
  - **Cursor:** `beforeSubmitPrompt` → `agentMessage`
  - **Hermes:** new `pre_llm_call` hook in the Python plugin → ephemeral context on the first LLM call of each session (idempotent per session for prompt-cache safety; re-armed on `on_session_reset`)
- No project markdown files (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `.cursorrules` / `.cursor/rules/`) are touched — the rule is injected through each agent's runtime context channel only.
- New `lib/rule-injection.js` exports `RULE_TEXT` — single source of truth for the >1-question contract; the shared hook script reads from it.
- Added test coverage: `test/post-write-hook.js` now exercises all four rule-injection paths and the `AGENT_FEEDBACK_DISABLED=1` opt-out. `test/installer.js` verifies the new groups are written and removed cleanly.

### Fixed
- **Hermes plugin was never actually loading.** The previous `__init__.py` exported a `__plugin__` dict but Hermes' plugin loader calls a top-level `register(ctx)` function. The plugin now exposes `register(ctx)` that wires the three hooks (`post_tool_call`, `pre_llm_call`, `on_session_reset`); legacy callable aliases are kept for any out-of-tree importers.
- Added `plugin.yaml` alongside `plugin.json` for Hermes' YAML-based manifest loader.

## [1.4.0]

### Added
- **Auto-open wrapped files in the user's default browser** after the hook compiles them (`open` on macOS, `start` on Windows, `xdg-open` on Linux). Closes the last manual step in the feedback loop — agents no longer need to remember to share or open the file. Works across all four harnesses (Hermes / Claude Code / Cursor / Codex). Opt out with `AGENT_FEEDBACK_AUTO_OPEN=0`. Auto-skipped in CI (`CI=1`) and on headless Linux (no `$DISPLAY` / `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY`).
- Agent-facing hook message updated to instruct the agent to stop and wait for the user's response, rather than continuing with dependent tool calls.

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **Output format unified to a single free-text prompt across all three tools.** The feedback questioner previously copied a JSON payload (`{"_type": "agent_feedback_response", …}`); it now copies the same structured natural-language prompt used by the annotator and md-annotator. Agents that parsed the old JSON shape must switch to reading the prompt text. See README → *Output prompt* for the new format.
- Removed the **Copy JSON** button from the shared annotation panel — Copy Prompt is now the only output.

### Added
- `src/shared/build-prompt.js` — single `buildAgentPrompt({ tool, source, items })` helper consumed by all three tools so the output shape is identical by construction.
- `scripts/record-demo.js` + `examples/demos/md-annotator.gif` — scripted Playwright + ffmpeg demo recorder (reusable for html-annotator and feedback). Recording requires Playwright (any 1.5x+) and ffmpeg available on `PATH`; neither is an npm dependency of this repo. Run with `NODE_PATH=/path/to/playwright/node_modules node scripts/record-demo.js md-annotator`.

### Fixed
- Light-mode the md-annotator comment popover (was dark on dark).
- Shrink md-annotator preview body and headings by ~15–20% for better page density.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-24

### Added
- **Native harness plugins** — `agent-feedback install` patches hook configs for Claude Code, Cursor (1.7+), Codex CLI, and Hermes Agent (0.9+).
- **Single shared hook script** (`plugins/shared/post-write-hook.js`) handles event normalization across all four harnesses.
- New CLI commands: `install`, `uninstall`, `doctor`, and the hidden `__hook` subcommand invoked by hook configs.
- New env vars: `AGENT_FEEDBACK_DISABLED=1` to bypass the hook, `AGENT_FEEDBACK_VERBOSE=0` for quieter agent messages.
- Per-harness `INSTALL.md` guides under `plugins/<harness>/`.
- Installer tests covering detection, install, idempotency, user-config preservation, and uninstall.
- Examples folder with `.html`, `.md`, and `.json` inputs + `npm run compile:examples` script.

### Changed
- Package renamed to `@nsharir/agent-feedback` (repo: `nsharir/agent-feedback`).
- Repo restructured: `plugins/` directory added alongside `src/`, `lib/`, `bin/`.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-24

### Added
- **Build system** — sources now live in `src/` and reference shared modules via `@include` directives. Run `npm run build` to regenerate `lib/templates/`.
- Shared modules under `src/shared/` (design tokens, clipboard, preview dialog, toast) — single source of truth across all three tools.
- `npm test` runs the build first to verify everything compiles.

### Changed
- Repo restructured for maintainability. Built templates are still committed so end users can install without a build step.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-05-24

### Fixed
- 3-tier clipboard fallback. When both `navigator.clipboard` and `execCommand('copy')` fail (e.g. `file://` contexts), the preview textarea is auto-selected and a hint shows the platform-specific keyboard shortcut.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-24

### Added
- **Preview & Edit dialog** for all three tools. Users can edit the generated prompt/payload before copying.
- Unified light theme across all three tools.

### Fixed
- Checkboxes now toggle correctly (previously toggled twice due to label/input event bubbling).
- Clipboard copy now reliably reports success/failure.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-23

Initial release. Three tools:
- HTML annotator (`.html` → annotation-enabled HTML)
- Markdown annotator (`.md` → rendered review page)
- Agent feedback (`.json` → structured question form)
